# Recap from last week 

In the previous session

   * We have seen a lot of tidyverse basics for data transformations and wrangling
   
      * Rows affecting functions (e.g., `filter`), column affecting functions (e.g., `mutate`)
      
      * We saw an aggregating function (`count`), and data introduction function (`glimpse`)
      
      * You want to exercise these as much as you can if you want to become proficient in data science
   
   * You experienced the various functions using the Himalayan Climbing Expeditions data set from the tidytuesday repository

# Today's focus: data wrangling continued, and visualizations

# What we will do today

   * Complete some things from last week
   
      * Operations that summarize data (e.g., compute mean, sd, percentiles)
   
   * Discuss the grammar of graphics
   
   * Learn and exercise `ggplot2`

---

# Operations that summarize data (summarize cases)

Apply summary functions to create a new table. 
To summarize data you need to combine `group_by`, `summarize`, and a summary function:

   * `group_by` and `summarize`, followed by:
   * `sum`, `n`, `mean`, `median`, `first`, `last`, `quantile`, `min`, `max`, `sd`

(Examples: line 108 in `02-Data-Transformations-and-Wrangling.R`)

---

# The datasarus dozen

Why are visualizations important?

   * It is an amazing way to communicate findings
   
   * Sometimes it's the only way
   
A classic example in the "Datasarus Dozen dataset"
.small[
```{r datasaurus dozen}
library(datasauRus)
glimpse(datasaurus_dozen)
```
]

---

# The datasarus dozen (mean, sd, and correlation)

What is the relationship between `x` and `y`?

We can group the datasets within datasarus_dozen and compute mean, sd, and correlation.

.small[
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
datasaurus_dozen %>% 
   group_by(dataset) %>% 
   summarize(
      mean_x = mean(x),
      mean_y    = mean(y),
      std_dev_x = sd(x),
      std_dev_y = sd(y),
      corr_x_y  = cor(x, y)
   )
```
]

---

# The datasarus dozen (mean, sd, and correlation)

What is the relationship between `x` and `y`?

.small[
```{r datasaurus dozen summarized, echo=FALSE}
datasaurus_dozen %>% 
   group_by(dataset) %>% 
   summarize(
      mean_x = mean(x),
      mean_y    = mean(y),
      std_dev_x = sd(x),
      std_dev_y = sd(y),
      corr_x_y  = cor(x, y)
   )
```
]

---

# The datasarus dozen - IT'S MAGIC! (Simpson's paradox)

.small[
```{r datasaurus dozen plotted, fig.dim=c(7, 7)}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen) + geom_point(aes(x, y)) + facet_wrap(~dataset)
```
]

---

# The grammar of graphics

Each variable in the data is mapped by an "aesthetic mapping":

   * Axis (x, y); Color; Fill; Alpha (transparency); Size; Shape; etc.

The aesthetics are combined with geometric functions, e.g.: 

   * Points, bars, lines, histograms, densities, etc (there are a lot of them)

These elements are implemented in the `ggplot2` package (which you've seen in the first session of this workshop)

   * We have a template! (and a cheat sheet)

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<GLOBAL MAPPINGS>)) + 
   <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

---

# Example: relationship of penguin flipper and bill length

.small[
```{r basic relationship}
library(palmerpenguins)
ggplot(penguins) + 
   geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm))
```
]

---

# Example: relationship of penguin flipper and bill length (questions)

```{r basic relationship questions, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) + 
   geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm))
```

   * What story does this chart tells you?
   
   * Is there a difference between penguin species?
   
   * What is the aesthetic mapping?
   
   * Why is there a warning message?

---

# Species matters

.small[
```{r basic relationship with species}
ggplot(penguins) + 
   geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm,
                  color = species))
```
]

--

   * What did you learn now that you didn't know before?

--
   
   * If you wanted to add gender (`sex`) to this comparison, how would you do that?

---

# Gender matters as well

.small[
```{r penguins with gender}
ggplot(penguins) + 
    geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm,
                   shape = species, color = sex))
```
]

--

   * What information was added to this chart?
   
--

   * The gender missing values, can you guess what they are?

---

# Adding regression models

.small[
```{r penguins with regression lines, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + 
   geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
]

--

   * Note the use of global aesthetic mappings

--

   * Note that you can add layers one after the other (a number of geoms)

---

# WARNING: Don't get carried away

There is such as a thing as too many details. 

   * The human mind can process $7\pm2$ items in short term memory (see [here](https://www.simplypsychology.org/short-term-memory.html))
 
.tiny[  
```{r penguins with body mass, fig.dim=c(8,5), warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) + geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, shape = species, color = sex, size = body_mass_g), alpha = 0.45) + facet_wrap(~island)
```
]

---

# Facets

Sometimes you need to "split" the plots according to a specific variable in order to make a point. This is called faceting. For example, we can replace the aesthetic mapping of `color=species` with faceting

.small[
```{r faceting example, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) + 
   geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
   facet_wrap(~species)
```
]

---

# Scales

Sometimes, we want to slightly modify aesthetic mappings. This can be accomplished using scales.

.small[
```{r scales example, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) + 
   geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + facet_wrap(~species) + 
   scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 60, by = 5))
```
]

--

We will see some more interesting examples (i.e., log scales) in the following sessions.

# Mini exercise: how would you...? (1)

   * Using the `ggplot2` cheat sheet, what are the three geoms required to produce this chart?
   * What are the aesthetic mappings?
   
```{r mini exercse 1, echo=FALSE}
sales <- tribble(~product, ~shift, ~sold,
        "coffee", "morning", 100,
        "coffee", "evening", 50,
        "fries", "morning", 10,
        "fries", "evening", 110,
        "beer", "morning", 15,
        "beer", "evening", 150,
        "cake", "morning", 40,
        "cake", "evening", 30) %>% 
  group_by(product) %>% 
  mutate(sales.prop = sold/sum(sold))

ggplot(sales, aes(x = product, y = sold, fill = shift, label = sold)) + 
  geom_col(position = "stack", color = "black") + 
  geom_label(position = position_stack(), show.legend = F) + 
  theme_bw() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") +
  ylab("sales") + xlab("product") + 
  ggtitle("Sales data") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

---

# Mini exercise: how would you...? (2)

   * Monthly Airline passenger numbers 1949-1960 (see `?AirPassengers`)
   * Use the ggplot2 cheat sheet
   * What is the **one** geom required to produce this chart?
   * What are the aesthetic mappings?
   
```{r mini exercise 2, echo=FALSE}
AirPassengers %>% 
   as_tibble() %>% 
   mutate(date = seq.Date(from = as.Date("1949-01-01"), 
                          to = as.Date("1960-12-01"), 
                          by = "months")) %>% 
   mutate(month = lubridate::month(date),
          year = lubridate::year(date)) %>% 
   mutate(passengers = as.numeric(x)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = year, y = month, fill = passengers)) + 
   geom_tile() + 
   scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:12)
```

---

# Mini exercise: how would you...? (3)

Same passengers data, different visualization: what are the aesthetics and geom? which visualization is better and why?

```{r mini exercise 3, echo=FALSE}
AirPassengers %>% 
   as_tibble() %>% 
   mutate(date = seq.Date(from = as.Date("1949-01-01"), 
                          to = as.Date("1960-12-01"), 
                          by = "months")) %>% 
   mutate(month = lubridate::month(date),
          year = lubridate::year(date)) %>% 
   mutate(passengers = as.numeric(x)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(color = factor(year), x = month, y = passengers)) + 
   geom_line() + 
   scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12)
```

# Final touch ups

.small[You can control every aspect of the chart. For example, you can change the theme, the labels and the title.]

.tiny[
```{r final touch ups, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + 
   geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
   labs(title = "Penguin bill and flipper length relationships",
        subtitle = "Separated by species",
        caption = "See package palmerpenguins for the original data set") + 
   xlab("Flipper length [mm]") +
