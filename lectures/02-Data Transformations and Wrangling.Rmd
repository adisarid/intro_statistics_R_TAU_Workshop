# Recap from last week 

In the previous session

   * You built your first plot in `R`!
   
   * You visualized google mobility trends in Israel, and discussed how they were affected by Covid-19
   
   * You saw how data is structured and discussed tidy data
   
   * We discussed the data science workflow
   
   * You saw the RStudio IDE and base-R syntax (i.e., for loops, if clauses, functions, and more)

# What we will do today

   * Focus on tidyverse syntax
   
   * Some quick tricks on getting to know your data
   
   * Learn how to transform data sets so they will be easier to analyze:
   
      * Operations that affect rows (e.g., filtering, arranging)
      
      * Operations that affect columns (e.g., selection, mutation)
      
      * Operations that summarize data (e.g., compute mean, sd, percentiles)
   
      * Changing the data representation (changing long to wide formats or vice verse)
      
      * Merging (joining) data sets

# Wrap up

   * We have seen a lot of tidyverse basics for data transformations and wrangling
   
      * Rows affecting functions, column affecting functions, summarizing functions, pivoting
      
      * These are all the must-have elements for data analysis
      
      * You want to exercise these as much as you can if you want to become proficient in data science
   
   * You experienced the various functions using the Himalayan Climbing Expeditions data set from the tidytuesday repository

# Optional homework

Analyze the [IKEA data set](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-03/readme.md), and answer:

   * How many different items appear in the data set?
   
   * What is the most frequently appearing category?
   
   * What is the most expensive category (on average? on median?)
   
   * How many different items are sellable online?
   
   * What is the average discount provided at the time of data collection?
   
   * What is the average size of a chair?
   
   * Who is the most common IKEA designer?
   
   * Create a new table with each row representing a product name, and each column representing a category. The table values should represent the number of products sold with that name and product category.
