# Recap from last week 

In the previous session

   * You built your first plot in `R`!
   
   * You visualized google mobility trends in Israel, and discussed how they were affected by Covid-19
   
   * You saw how data is structured and discussed tidy data
   
   * We discussed the data science workflow
   
   * You saw the RStudio IDE and base-R syntax (i.e., for loops, if clauses, functions, and more)

# What we will do today

   * Focus on tidyverse syntax
   
   * Some quick tricks on getting to know your data
   
   * Learn how to transform data sets so they will be easier to analyze:
   
      * Operations that affect rows (e.g., filtering, arranging)
      
      * Operations that affect columns (e.g., selection, mutation)
      
      * Operations that summarize data (e.g., compute mean, sd, percentiles)
   
      * Changing the data representation (changing long to wide formats or vice verse)
      
      * Merging (joining) data sets

# Some quick tricks to get to know your data

Prerequisite: throughout the exercise we will use the `tidyverse` packages. To install them use `install.packages(tidyvers)` and then run `library(tiydverse)` in your script.

   * The pipe is very useful `%>%`

When you explore a dataset for the first time, use:

   * `glimpse` to see what variables there are
   * `head` (and `tail`) to see the first few first (and last) set of lines
   * `View` to see the data in a table
   * `count` to count a specific variable or combination of variables

---

# Operations that affect rows (manipulate cases)

These are operations like sorting the rows according to a specific variable, filtering tables, sampling, or taking distinct values

   * `filter` (remember logical operators?)
   * `arrange`
   * `sample_n` and `sample_frac`
   * `slice`
   * `distinct`

---

# Operations that affect columns (manipulate variables)

These are operations that help you transform variables, create new variables, select specific variables

   * `select` to select specific variables
   * `mutate` to create or modify variables
   * `mutate_*` and `across`

<img src="dplyr_mutate.png" width="35%" height="auto">

---

# Operations that summarize data (summarize cases)

Apply summary functions to create a new table. 
To summarize data you need to combine `group_by`, `summarize`, and a summary function:

   * `group_by` and `summarize`, followed by:
   * `sum`, `n`, `mean`, `median`, `first`, `last`, `quantile`, `min`, `max`, `sd`

---

# Changing the data representation (long vs. wide)

Very often you will be required to change the data representation, from wide to long format (or vice verse).

   * This is called pivoting, and you can use `pivot_longer` or `pivot_wider`
   * Especially useful when plotting with `ggplot2`, which we will discuss next week

---

# Joining data sets (combine tables)

Sometimes we have multiple sources of data, and we need to join them, or add them to one another

   * Joining = Combining variables, adding new columns using shared key variables (`left_join`, `right_join`, `full_join`)
   * Binding = Combining cases, adding new rows from another source, which has the same variables (`bind_rows`)

---

# Summarising exercise

In this exercise you will explore (transform and wrangle) [Himalayan Climbing Expeditions](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-22/readme.md).

   * Expeditions that climbed in the Nepal Himalaya
   
   * To complete this exercise you will need R, RStudio IDE. 
   
   * Download and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/adisarid/intro_statistics_R_TAU_Workshop/blob/main/labs/Tidying%20Himalayan%20Climbing%20Expeditions/02-Data-Transformations-and-Wrangling-Himalayan-Exercise.R)

# Wrap up

   * We have seen a lot of tidyverse basics for data transformations and wrangling
   
      * Rows affecting functions, column affecting functions, summarizing functions, pivoting
      
      * These are all the must-have elements for data analysis
      
      * You want to exercise these as much as you can if you want to become proficient in data science
   
   * You experienced the various functions using the Himalayan Climbing Expeditions data set from the tidytuesday repository

# Optional homework

Analyze the [IKEA data set](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-03/readme.md), and answer:

   * How many different items appear in the data set? 
   
   * What is the most frequently appearing category?
   
   * What is the most expensive category (on average? on median?)
   
   * How many different items are sellable online?
   
   * What is the average discount provided at the time of data collection?
   
   * What is the average size of a chair?
   
   * Create a new table with each row representing a product name, and each column representing a category. The table values should represent the number of products sold with that name and product category.
