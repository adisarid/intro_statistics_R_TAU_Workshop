# Who is this workshop for?

   * Since this workshop is given online, anyone is welcome, but specifically:
   
   * This workshop is for students in the digital science for hi-tech program in TAU
   
   * No prior knowledge in `R` programming language
   
   * Studying introduction to statistics in the management school (can't attend the built-in intro statistics course of the digital sciences program)

---

# Workshop Goals

   * Students will acquire `R` skills
   
   * Learn how `R` can be used for preparing data, visualizing data, and modeling data
   
   * We will assume that you already know the theory behind statistics, and focus on practical (and fun!) stuff

   * **By the end of the workshop students will be able to take a data set and analyze it in meaningful ways, drawing conclusions, and presenting the results.**

---

# What to expect today?

   * Today you will build your first plot in `R`!
   
   * You will visualize google mobility trends in Israel, and discuss how they were affected by Covid-19
   
   * You will see how data is structured (and discuss tidy data)
   
   * You will discuss the data origin and see problems with it
   
   * We will see the RStudio IDE and demonstrate base-R syntax

---

# Technical details

Our workshop is going to be comprised of:
   
   * Lectures: background and explanations
   
   * Demonstrations: live coding and analysis of data sets
      
   * Labs: these are either tutorials as we will do today, or coding in your computer in R
   
   * Optional home assignments: tasks I will give each week (which I will solve in the following session)

---

# Tech stack / sources

   * All the code and materials are available on github: [https://bit.ly/tau-r-workshop](https://bit.ly/tau-r-workshop)
   
   * You will need [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) which are both open source and free to download and use
   
   * The `tidyverse` package (`install.packages("tidyverse")`)
   
   * Syllabus, books, youtube channels, and other sources: see github repo README.md under reading materials.

# Covid19 mobility trends

   * For this lab we're going to split to breakout rooms
   
   * Each group will solve the exercise here: [sarid.shinyapps.io/covid19_mobility](sarid.shinyapps.io/covid19_mobility)
   
   * We will give 20 minutes for this exercise, but I will circulate among the rooms and see if you need more/less time
   
   * Upon completion, we will solve the exercise together

# Back to the basics

Switching to some live coding session:

   * We will demonstrate base R syntax
   
   * We will familiarize ourselves with the RStudio IDE

# Tidy data: tidy versus untidy

<img src="tidydata_2.jpg" width="80%" height="auto">

**Excel users have a tendency to get data to be untidy:** merged cells, colored cells, aggregated cells, skipping rows, hidden columns, formulas, pivot tables, etc...
