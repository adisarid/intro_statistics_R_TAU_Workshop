# Exercise 1: initial exploration of the data -----------------------------

# Using functions such as glimpse, count, and View, explore the three data sets
# * Discuss what you see within your group, and answer:
# * What is the size of each data set? (number of cases = rows and number of variables = columns)
# * What are the relationships between the data sets? (how are they related to one another)
# * What variables are shared between the data sets?
# * Which variable indicates when a peak was first ascended?
# * How can you find out if and when a specific expedition reached the peak?
# * How would you find out the role of a specific expedition member, and if he suffered an injury?
# * How would you find the number of deaths with a specific expedition?
#      (at this stage don't compute it, just think how to - we will do it later on)
# * How would you find the number of injuries with a specific expedition?
#      (at this stage don't compute it, just think how to - we will do it later on)
